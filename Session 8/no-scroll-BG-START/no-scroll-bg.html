Paul finished the game with 20 points and 15 assists to earn MVP honors, while Durant, the reigning All-Star Game MVP, scored a game-high 30 points.</p>
      
            <p>Paul and Durant were especially good closing out the game, trading off big plays to help put the
            East away. Paul capped off his brilliant night with a 3-pointer in the eye of big man Joakim Noah.
            Paul's teammate Blake Griffin also had a big game, scoring 19 points and doing a lot of damage off
            lobs from the point guard.</p>
     
            <p>The East fought valiantly throughout, with a flurry of threes by Paul George and Carmelo Anthony
            keeping the game close. But there was just too much Paul and Durant, and Griffin put an exclamation
            point on the West victory with a ferocious dunk on a pass to himself off the backboard. Kobe Bryant
            also gave the crowd a rise with multiple blocks of LeBron James down the stretch.</p>
     
            <p>Anthony scored 26 points and grabbed 12 rebounds to lead the East. James scored 19 points, while
            teammate Dwyane Wade had 21 points on 10-of-13 shooting. George added 17 points off the bench.</p>
