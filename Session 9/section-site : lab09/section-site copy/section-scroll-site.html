His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica ("Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"), first published in 1687, laid the foundations of classical mechanics. Newton also made pathbreaking contributions to optics, and he shares credit with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing the infinitesimal calculus.</p></td>

					<h2>To Serve Man, with Software</h2>
					<p>31 Dec 2017</p>
				</header>
				<main>
					<p>I didn't choose to be a programmer. Somehow, it seemed, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/if-loving-computers-is-wrong-i-dont-want-to-be-right/">the computers chose me</a>. For a long time, that was fine, that was enough; that was all I needed. But along the way I never felt that being a programmer was this <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/please-dont-learn-to-code/">unambiguously great-for-everyone</a> career field with zero downsides. There are absolutely occupational hazards of being a programmer, and <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/your-favorite-programming-quote/">one of my favorite programming quotes</a> is an allusion to one of them:</p>
					<blockquote>
					<p>It should be noted that no ethically-trained software engineer would ever consent to write a <code>DestroyBaghdad</code> procedure. Basic professional ethics would instead require him to write a <code>DestroyCity</code> procedure, to which Baghdad could be given as a parameter.</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Which reminds me of <a href="https://waxy.org/2015/12/tracking_the_trump_is_a_comment_section_running_for_president_joke/">another joke that people were telling in 2015</a>:</p>
					<blockquote>
					<p>Donald Trump is basically a comment section running for president</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Which is troubling because technically, <em>technically</em>, I run a company that <a href="https://discourse.org">builds comment sections</a>.</p>
					<p>Here at the tail end of 2017, from where I sit neither of these jokes seem particularly funny to me any more. Perhaps I have lost the capacity to feel joy as a human being? <em>Haha just kidding!</em> <em>... kinda.</em></p>
					<p>Remember <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">in 2011</a> when Marc Andreeseen said that &quot;Software is eating the world?&quot;</p>
					<p><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/12/software-is-eating-the-world-marc-andreessen.jpg" alt="software is eating the world, Marc Andreessen"></p>
					<p>That used to sound all hip and cool and inspirational, like &quot;Wow! We software developers really <em>are</em> making a difference in the world!&quot; and now for the life of me I can't read it as anything other than an ominous warning that we just weren't smart enough to translate properly at the time. But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Serve_Man_(The_Twilight_Zone)">maybe now we are</a>.</p>
					<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Serve_Man_(The_Twilight_Zone)"><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/12/to-serve-man.jpg" alt="to-serve-man"></a></p>
					<p>I've said many, many times that the key to becoming an experienced software developer is to understand that you are, at all times, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/on-the-meaning-of-coding-horror/">your own worst enemy</a>. I don't mean this in a negative way – you have to constantly plan for and design around your inevitable human mistakes and fallibility. It's fundamental to good software engineering because, well, we're all human. The good-slash-bad news is that you're only <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-trap-you-set-for-yourself/"><em>accidentally</em> out to get yourself</a>. But what happens when we're infinitely connected and software is suddenly <em>everywhere</em>, in everyone's pockets every moment of the day, starting to approximate a natural extension of our bodies? All of a sudden those little collective social software accidents become <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-other-tech-bubble/">considerably more dangerous</a>:</p>
					<blockquote>
					<p>The issue is bigger than any single scandal, I told him. As headlines have exposed the troubling inner workings of company after company, startup culture no longer feels like fodder for gentle parodies about ping pong and hoodies. It feels ugly and rotten. Facebook, the greatest startup success story of this era, isn’t a merry band of hackers building cutesy tools that allow you to digitally Poke your friends. It’s a powerful and potentially sinister collector of personal data, a propaganda partner to government censors, and an enabler of discriminatory advertising.</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>I'm reminded of a particular Mitchell and Webb skit: <em>&quot;Are we the baddies?&quot;</em></p>

					<h2>The Existential Terror of Battle Royale</h2>
					<p>5 Nov 2017</p>
				</header>
				<main>
					<p>It's been a while since I wrote a blog post, I guess in general, but also a blog post about video games. Video games are probably <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ablog.codinghorror.com+%22video+games%22">the single thing most attributable to my career as a programmer</a>, and everything else I've done professionally after that. I still feel video games are one of the best ways to learn and teach programming, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/heres-the-programming-game-you-never-asked-for/">if properly scoped</a>, and furthermore I take <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/level-one-the-intro-stage/">many cues from video games in building software</a>.</p>
					<p>I would characterize my state of mind for the last six to eight months as … <em>poor</em>. Not only because of <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/im-loyal-to-nothing-except-the-dream/">current events in the United States</a>, though the neverending barrage of bad news weighs heavily on me, and I continue to be profoundly disturbed by the erosion of core values that I thought most of us stood for as Americans. Didn't we used to look out for each other, care about each other, and fight to protect those that can't protect themselves?</p>
					<p>In times like these, I sometimes turn to video games for escapist entertainment. One game in particular caught my attention because of its meteoric rise in player count over the last year.</p>
					<p><a href="http://steamcharts.com/app/578080"><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/11/pubg-steam-stats-nov-2017.png" alt="pubg-steam-stats-nov-2017"></a></p>
					<p>That game is <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/578080/PLAYERUNKNOWNS_BATTLEGROUNDS/">Player Unknown's Battlegrounds</a>. I was increasingly curious why it was so popular, and kept getting more popular every month. Calling it a mere phenomenon seems like underselling it; something truly unprecedented is happening here. I finally broke down and bought a copy for $30 in September.</p>
					<p><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/11/player-unknown-battleground.jpg" alt="player-unknown-battleground"></p>
					<p>After a few hours in, I had major flashbacks to <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-gamification/">the first time I played Counter-Strike in 1998</a>. I realized that <strong>we are witnessing the birth of an entirely new genre of game: the Battle Royale</strong>. I absolutely believe that huge numbers of people will still be playing some form of this game 20 years from now, too.</p>
					<p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/stats/"><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2017/11/steam-top-games-by-player-count-nov-2017.png" alt="steam-top-games-by-player-count-nov-2017"></a></p>
					<p>I've seen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Royale_(film)">the Japanese movie</a>, and it's true that there were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_royale_game">a few Battle Royale games</a> before PUBG, but this is clearly the defining moment and game for the genre, the one that sets a precedent for everyone else to follow.</p>
					<p>It's hard to explain why Battlegrounds is so compelling, but let's start with the loneliness.</p>
					<p>Although you can play in squads (and I recommend it), the purest original form of the game is 100 players, last man standing. You begin with nothing but the clothes on your back, in a cargo aircraft, flying over an unknown island in a random trajectory.</p>
