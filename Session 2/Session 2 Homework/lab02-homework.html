      <h3 id="question1">1. Order Not Delivered</h3>
        
        <p>
          Since the removal of of Miiverse (which I used constantly to save in-Game screenshots of story of seasons, corpse party, rune factory and other games of the sort.) I have no other way to save those (and image share doesn't help as it only accesses the SD card, and only a very few games take "screenshots" if you can call them that. Only animal crossing takes screenshots like I'd like.) I'm looking for a way or even ANY information on if Nintendo plans to do anything about this. I constantly doodled picture based on my In-game screenshots all the time. It was fun. And part of my own personal gameplay experience. Which has been dulled by Miiverses removal as I cannot fall into my normal routine. (My fault completely for relying on Miiverse as I did.) I'd constantly access it from my phone to save my screenshots/doodles when I thought about it. I need a screenshot replacement. Even if it means some how connecting my 3ds to my computer to take a clear screenshot as before (because taking a picture with my phone isn't cutting it.)
