        <p>
          I had rented this game's original edition out of curiosity, and found a surprisingly expansive single payer experience. I had spent 15 hours of playtime just exploring a FOURTH of the world. The diverse environments that will make you stop and stare, two dozen enemy types to conquer, a variety of weapons to customize and discover, the AWESOME lore to find both in the open world and enclosed areas that reveal the past and explain the present, on top of the surprises in not just the main story, but added in the Frozen Wilds DLC, make this game a must buy for a single-player gamer like me.

          Oh, and the voice acting is pretty much top notch.
